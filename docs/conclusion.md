At this point, you should have a good understanding of *git* basic concepts and to have a pretty good amount
of basic *git* commands in your hands that you will need for your everyday work with *git*.
In some parts, we dig a bit deeper into how *git* is handling some parts internally and you may think that
this should not be included in a guide like this, but it is really important to understand some parts deeply
because it can help you later on to understand some advanced concepts such as rebasing, squashing, cherry-picking etc.

I hope that this guide helped you to become confident using *git* and that you've gained enough knowledge
to be productive while working on your projects.
