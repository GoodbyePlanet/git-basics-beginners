If you are completely new to *git* and you don't have it installed on your machine then follow these instructions based on your OS.

#### Instaling on Linux

If you are using Debian-based distribution such as Ubuntu:

`$ sudo apt-get install git`

#### For CentOS and Fedora:

`$ sudo dnf install git`

#### Installing on MacOS

To install *git* on MacOS you can use **Homebrew**:

`$ brew install git`

#### Installing on Windows

To install *git* on Windows you will have to download the installer from the Git website. Just go to this [site](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Download the installer and follow the installation guide.
If you are reading this part and you've just finished with *git* installation and you most probably don't have **git environment** customized
**git config** is the command that allows us to setup configuration variables. Let's see how to configure git in the next section.
